# Creating a LinkedIn Banner Image

I wanted to create an image for the banner of my LinkedIn profile that illustrated my professional and personal interests. So, using R I created a graph that resembles mountain ranges near sunset (thus illustrating my interest in data science as well as the outdoors).

The values for the graph were somewhat randomly selected (in the future I will look for an opportunity to use real data). I used one of the [incredible national parks color palettes](https://github.com/kevinsblake/NatParksPalettes) to create the depth in the mountains and then added a sun to finish things off:
